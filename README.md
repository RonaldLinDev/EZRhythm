## Results

## EZ Rhythm ECG Device

- **Low production costs** ($8.86 USB without battery, $13.61 with battery)
  - Provides affordable and accessible means for ECG data recording.
  - Production is a fraction of the cost of industry equivalents ($300 - $500).
- **Internet Capabilities, Data uploaded in One Click**
  - Ease of Use to be deployed in disadvantaged populations; Less experts needed to use the device.
- **Continuous Monitor**
  - Capable of recording for extended periods, allowing for a higher diagnostic yield when diagnosing paroxysmal arrhythmias.

### Web Server

- Cloud Processing and Telemedicine lift the burden on local infrastructure.
- Cardiologists do not have to manually review 24+ hours of ECG data, and have the liberty to view an appended summary.

### The Final Diagnostics Model

- **Sensitivity and specificity (91% and 99%) reached cardiologist-level sensitivity and specificity.**
- High specificity addresses general ECG issue of False Positives. Higher sensitivity (**91%** vs 73%) can better detect undiagnosed patients.
- Application of Patient Specific Morphology Comparison (**PSMC**) significantly increased per class accuracy of the model, demonstrating the effectiveness of patient-specific comparison machine learning.
  - This technique can transform the detection of not just ECG-based disease but also other time series biosignals like EGGs to significantly improve sensitivity and specificity given disproportionate data.

### EZ Rhythm System

- First low-cost pipeline for Arrhythmia screening, diagnosis, and Cardiologist review.
- EZ Rhythm is vital to counteracting the rise of Arrhythmia in developing countries.
